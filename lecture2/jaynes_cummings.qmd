# The Jaynes–Cummings model: The Prove of Field Quantization {#sec-jaynes-cummings}

At the crossroads of **quantum optics** and **cavity QED**, the **Jaynes–Cummings (JC) model** stands out as the simplest non‑trivial arena in which a *single* photon mode interacts with a *single* two‑level atom. Despite – or perhaps because of – its austerity, it captures phenomena that range from vacuum Rabi oscillations to Schrödinger‑cat states.  In what follows I weave together the *story* of the model, its mathematics, and its experimental vindication, culminating in Serge Haroche’s celebrated observation of field quantisation.

## The Jaynes–Cummings Hamiltonian: more than a toy

The JC Hamiltonian was born amid a heated 1960s debate over whether maser radiation had to be quantised.  Edward Jaynes and Frederick Cummings answered with a fully quantum description whose predictions flatly contradicted semi‑classical intuition.  In the rotating‑wave approximation it reads

$$
\hat H = \omega_c  \hat a^{\dagger}\hat a + \frac{\omega_q}{2} \hat\sigma_z +  g\bigl(\hat a^{\dagger}\hat\sigma_{-}+\hat a \hat\sigma_{+}\bigr).
$$

where $\hat a$ is the cavity field’s annihilation operator, $\hat\sigma_z$ is the atom’s Pauli operator, and $g$ is the coupling strength.  The first two terms describe the free evolution of cavity and atom, while the last term couples them.

The JC model conserves the total excitation number $N = \hat a^{\dagger}\hat a + \hat\sigma_+\hat\sigma_-$.  This means that the Hilbert space decomposes into sectors of fixed $N$, each spanned by the states

$$
|\psi_{n, 1}\rangle = |n, e\rangle \quad \text{and} \quad |\psi_{n, 2}\rangle = |n+1, g\rangle
$$

The JC Hamiltonian acts within each sector as a $2\times2$ matrix

$$
\hat H_{n} = \begin{pmatrix}
\omega_c n + \frac{\omega_q}{2} & g\sqrt{n+1} \\
g\sqrt{n+1} & \omega_c (n+1) - \frac{\omega_q}{2}
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

The eigenvalues of this matrix are

$$
E_{n, \pm} = (n + \frac{1}{2}) \omega_c \pm \frac{1}{2} \Omega_n
$$ {#eq-jc-eigenvalues}

where

$$
\Omega_n = \sqrt{(\omega_c - \omega_q)^2 + 4g^2(n+1)}
$$ {#eq-jc-rabi-frequency}

is the Rabi frequency.

### Collapse and revival in plain words

When the cavity field is prepared in a coherent state $|\alpha\rangle$ and the atom in its ground state $|g\rangle$, the atomic inversion can be written as a superposition of Rabi oscillations at frequencies $\Omega_n$, each weighted by the Poisson probability $P_n=e^{-|α|^2}|α|^{2n}/n!$.  The resulting interference leads to an initial collapse of the oscillations, followed by a revival. The time evolution of the atomic inversion is given by

$$
\langle \hat\sigma_z(t) \rangle = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} P_n\,\cos\bigl(2\Omega_n\,t\bigr) \, .
$$

## The open-system perspective

Real cavities leak, as well as electrons in the atom decay.  To account for this, we can extend the JC Hamiltonian with a Lindblad term that describes the interaction with the environment.  The master equation for the density operator $\rho$ reads

$$
\dot\rho = -\tfrac{i}{\hbar}[\hat H,\rho] + \kappa\,\mathcal D[\hat a]\rho + \gamma\,\mathcal D[\hat\sigma_-]\rho,
$$

with $\mathcal D[\hat O]\rho = \hat O\rho\hat O^{\dagger} - \tfrac12{\hat O^{\dagger}\hat O,\rho}$ being the Lindblad dissipator. When $\kappa$ and $\gamma$ are small compared to the Rabi frequency, the JC model is in the strong-coupling regime, where the coherent oscillations are visible despite the dissipation. On the contrary, if $\kappa$ or $\gamma$ are large, the oscillations are damped and eventually disappear, which corresponds to the weak-coupling regime.

## Damped vacuum Rabi oscillations: The *hello‑world* of cavity QED

We now simulate the open system dynamics of the JC model, starting from the $|\psi(0)\rangle = |0,e\rangle$ state and watch excitation watch the atomic population in time. Theory predicts a cosine at frequency $2g$, blurred by an exponential envelope $e^{-\kappa t/2}$.

## Demonstration of Electromagnetic Field Quantization: The Haroche Experiment

A landmark experiment that unambiguously demonstrated the quantization of the electromagnetic field was conducted by **Serge Haroche's group** in the 1990s [@Brune1996Quantum]. The experiment used high-**Q** superconducting microwave cavities prepared in a **coherent state** $|\alpha\rangle$. Rydberg atoms were sent one at a time through the cavity, interacting dispersively with the quantized field. The population of the atomic excited state was measured as a function of the atom-cavity interaction time.

### Key Observations:

- The atomic population exhibited **collapse and revival** dynamics.
- These revivals correspond to the quantum interference between Rabi oscillations at different frequencies $\Omega_n = \Omega_0 \sqrt{n+1}$, each associated with a Fock state component $|n\rangle$ in the coherent state.
- A **Fourier transform** of the signal revealed multiple peaks, each corresponding to a discrete photon number.

This experiment **cannot be explained** using a classical field description. The observed dynamics and frequency components are direct evidence of the **discrete (quantized) nature** of the electromagnetic field. It remains one of the most compelling demonstrations of field quantization in quantum optics.

### Preparing the coherent field

To simulate Haroche’s experiment, we need to prepare a coherent state $|\alpha\rangle$ in the cavity and a two-level atom in its ground state.

We can now use the `mesolve` function to evolve the system in time, while measuring the atomic population.

### Fourier spectroscopy: The signature of Fock states

Each Fock state $|n\rangle$ drives the atom at $\Omega_n = 2g\sqrt{n+1}$, so the Fourier transform of $\langle \hat\sigma_z(t)\rangle$ must exhibit a comb at precisely those spacings.

This plot worths the Nobel prize in 2012, as it shows the quantization of the electromagnetic field. Indeed, the peaks at $2g\sqrt{n+1}$ are a direct signature of the Fock states $|n\rangle$ in the coherent state $|\alpha\rangle$. Each peak corresponds to a different photon number, and their spacing reflects the quantized nature of the electromagnetic field.
