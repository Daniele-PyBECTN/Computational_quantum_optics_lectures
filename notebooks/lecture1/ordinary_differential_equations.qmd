# Ordinary Differential Equations

In this notebook, we'll explore how to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in practice, focusing on two approaches:

1.  **Matrix Diagonalization** for linear, time-independent systems.\
2.  **Numerical Integration** using the forward Euler method.

We'll also connect these methods to the Schr√∂dinger equation, showing how the same ideas appear in quantum mechanical problems.

## 1. Solving a Linear ODE by Diagonalization

### Example: Harmonic Oscillator

The harmonic oscillator is described by the second-order ODE:

$$
\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x = 0,
$$

which can be rewritten as a first-order system:

$$
\begin{cases}
\frac{dx}{dt} = v, \\
\frac{dv}{dt} = -\omega^2 x.
\end{cases}
$$

or, in matrix form:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ v \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -\omega^2 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ v \end{pmatrix}.
$$

By diagonalizing the matrix, we can find the solution to this system.

We have:

-   `A`: the system matrix.
-   `y0`: initial condition $\mathbf{y}(0)$.
-   We diagonalize $A$ to find $A = V D V^{-1}$.
-   Then $\exp(A t) = V \exp(D t) V^{-1}$.

If you run the code, you'll see the final value of $\mathbf{y}(2)$.\
We could also visualize the time evolution:

## 2. Numerical Integration via the Forward Euler Method

Let's now implement the **forward Euler** method for a simpler ODE. Consider the same harmonic oscillator, Euler's method approximates the evolution as:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
  x_{n+1} \\ v_{n+1}
\end{pmatrix} \simeq
\begin{pmatrix}
  x_n \\ v_n
\end{pmatrix} + h \,
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\ -\omega^2 & 0
\end{pmatrix} \,
\begin{pmatrix}
  x_n \\ v_n
\end{pmatrix},
$$

where $h$ is the time step.

Here we see how the Euler solution compares to the exact solution obtained via diagonalization. Notice that using a large time step $h$ can cause the Euler solution to deviate significantly from the exact decay (and may even diverge if $|1 - \lambda h| \ge 1$).
