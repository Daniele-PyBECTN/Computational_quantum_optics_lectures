# Code Cells

This directory contains the single quarto files `<cell_name>.qmd` that are included in the notebook files. This is a temporary workaround of current issues of the *embed* directive in Quarto.

The *embed* directive can be used once the following issues are resolved:

- [#9649](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/9649)
- [#10520](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10520)
- [#12789](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/12789)
