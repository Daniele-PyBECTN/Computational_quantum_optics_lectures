# Closed Quantum Systems in QuTiP

{{< embed /notebooks/lecture1/closed_systems.qmd#imports echo=true >}}

In @sec-quantum-harmonic-oscillator we have already defined the quantum harmonic oscillator, which is a fundamental model in quantum mechanics. In the energy eigenbasis, the quantum harmonic oscillator is described by the Hamiltonian

$$
\hat{H} = \omega \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} \, ,
$$

where $\omega$ is the resonance frequency and $\hat{a}$ is the bosonic annihilation operator. In this basis, the Hamiltonian is indeed diagonal, with eigenvalues $E_n = \omega n$, where $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

## Passing in the position basis

From the classical point of view, we are used to describe the harmonic oscillator in terms of position and momentum. In quantum mechanics, we can also express the system in terms of the position and momentum operators, which are related to the annihilation and creation operators as follows ($\hbar = 1$):

\begin{align*}
\hat{x} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 m \omega}} \left( \hat{a} + \hat{a}^\dagger \right) \, , \\
\hat{p} &= i \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{2}} \left( \hat{a}^\dagger - \hat{a} \right) \, .
\end{align*}


We first check that

$$
\left[ \hat{x}, \hat{p} \right] = i
$$

We now numerically diagonalize the position operator $\hat{x}$, such that $\hat{U}^\dagger \hat{x} \hat{U}$ is diagonal. Then we plot the eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator in the new basis, obtained with

$$
\vert \phi_n (x) \rangle = \hat{U}^\dagger \vert \psi_n \rangle
$$

## Closed Dynamics: The Schrödinger equation

### From wavefunctions to the Schrödinger equation in configuration space

In @sec-classical-liouville-equation we moved from **Hamilton’s equations** for a single point to **Liouville’s equation** for an ensemble. Quantum mechanics follows a similar path, replacing phase-space densities with **wavefunctions** (or density operators). We now show this parallelism in detail.

#### From a single wavepacket to the quantum continuity law

A non-relativistic quantum system in one dimension is described by a complex wavefunction $\psi(x,t)$. Its **probability density** and **current** are

$$
\rho(x,t) \;=\; |\psi(x,t)|^2, \qquad
j(x,t) \;=\; \frac{\hbar}{m}\,\Im\!\bigl[\psi^{\!*}(x,t)\,\partial_x \psi(x,t)\bigr].
$$

Starting from the **time-dependent Schrödinger equation**

$$
i\hbar\,\partial_t \psi(x,t) \;=\; \hat H\,\psi(x,t) \quad\text{with}\quad
\hat H \;=\; -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\,\partial_x^2 + V(x)
$$ {#eq-schrodinger}

and its complex conjugate, a short calculation yields the **continuity equation**

$$
\partial_t \rho + \partial_x j \;=\; 0,
$$ {#eq-continuity}

which plays the same role as Liouville’s incompressibility condition: probability is **transported** in configuration space without being created or destroyed.

#### The Schrödinger equation as a linear ODE in Hilbert space

While @eq-schrodinger is a partial differential equation, it is *linear* in $\psi$, exactly like the matrix ODE $\dot{\mathbf y}=A\mathbf y$ used for classical linear systems. Written in Dirac notation

$$
i\hbar\,\frac{d}{dt}\,|\psi(t)\rangle \;=\; \hat H\,|\psi(t)\rangle,
$$

the resemblance becomes explicit: **replace** the classical matrix $A$ by the quantum Hamiltonian operator $\hat H$ and the state vector $\mathbf y$ by a ket $|\psi\rangle$.

For statistical mixtures one introduces the **density operator** $\hat\rho$ and obtains the **von Neumann equation**

$$
i\hbar\,\partial_t \hat\rho \;=\; [\hat H,\,\hat\rho],
$$ {#eq-vonneumann}

a direct quantum counterpart of the Liouville equation in @eq-liouville-ode-classical.

With these ingredients we now possess a one-to-one map between the **classical Liouville formulation** and the **quantum Schrödinger formulation**, both expressible as sparse linear ODEs ready for numerical treatment. In QuTip, the Schrödinger equation is solved with the function `sesolve`, which stands for "Schrödinger equation solver".

### Plot the expectation values

We can access to the expectation values with the command `sol.expect[i]`, where `i` is the index of the $i$-th operator for which we want to calculate te expectation value as a function of time.

### Access directly to the evolution of the state

We can also access directly to the wavefunction at each `tlist`. This can be done by simply calling `sol.states` to the solver without the `e_ops` operators.

To check this feature, let's see if after $10$ cycles we get still the initial state, by calculating the fidelity

$$
\langle \psi \left(t = 10 T\right) \vert \psi \left( t = 0 \right) \rangle
$$

where $T = \frac{2 \pi}{\omega}$.

{{< embed /notebooks/lecture1/closed_systems.qmd#sesolve-fidelity echo=true >}}

We then switch to the position eigenbasis. Thus, we need to diagonalize the position operator. This in general involves the *Laguerre* functions, but here we limit ourselves to numerically diagonalize the position operator.

We now show the wavefunctions in the position basis at three different times: $t_0$, $t_1$ and $t_2$, with

$$
t_0 = 0 \, , \quad t_1 = \frac{\pi}{\omega} \, , \quad t_2 = \frac{2 \pi}{\omega} \, ,
$$

showing the exact periodicity of this system.

We can also export an animation, showing more easily the time evolution of the state
