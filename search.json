Photons leak from cavities, solid‑state qubits couple to phonons, and measurement back‑action reshapes quantum states in real time. In these scenarios the open character of the system—the interplay between coherent evolution and irreversible processes—becomes the defining feature, not a perturbation. Analytical solutions exist only for a handful of toy models; to design devices, interpret data, and test conceptual ideas we therefore rely on numerical simulation of open quantum dynamics.\nNumerical methods allow us to:",

Three qualities make it particularly compelling for our purposes:\n\nExpressiveness – A succinct, readable syntax lowers cognitive overhead and lets us translate mathematical ideas into code quickly.\nRich ecosystem – Numpy, SciPy, Jupyter, Matplotlib, and data‑analysis libraries coexist seamlessly, providing everything from linear algebra kernels to publication‑quality plots.\nCommunity & portability – Tutorials, StackOverflow answers, CI pipelines, and cloud platforms such as Google Colab enable beginners to run the same notebooks locally or on GPUs in the cloud with negligible setup.\n\nMost importantly, Python hosts QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python)(Johansson, Nation, and Nori 2012; Lambert et al. 2024) the de‑facto standard library for simulating open quantum systems. QuTiP wraps efficient C and Fortran back‑ends behind a high‑level interface: you manipulate Qobj instances instead of raw matrices, and you call solvers such as mesolve or mcsolve for Lindblad‑master equations and quantum trajectory simulations, respectively. The package is actively maintained, well documented, and battle‑tested across thousands of research papers.",

    "text": "2.4 A glance at Julia and QuantumToolbox.jl\nWhile Python dominates current scientific computing, it is not the only contender. In recent years, researchers and engineers have been exploring the need for a new programming language—one that combines the performance of compiled languages like C or Fortran with the ease of use and readability of scripting languages like Python or MATLAB. This is the motivation behind Julia.\nJulia promises “C‑like speed with Python‑like syntax” by using just‑in‑time (JIT) compilation and a multiple‑dispatch programming model. Within this language, the package QuantumToolbox.jl(Mercurio et al. 2025) has emerged as a high‑performance analog to QuTiP. It mirrors QuTiP’s API but benefits from Julia’s performance model and native automatic differentiation. Benchmarks already demonstrate significant speed‑ups, especially for large Hilbert spaces and GPU‑accelerated workloads.\nNevertheless, Julia’s ecosystem is still maturing. Its tooling, package stability, and IDE support are evolving rapidly but are not yet as robust as Python’s. Similarly, QuantumToolbox.jl, while powerful, has a smaller user base and fewer educational resources compared to QuTiP. For a course focused on accessibility and broad applicability, we therefore choose to prioritize Python and QuTiP as the more mature and stable learning platform.",

    "text": "2.6 First steps in Python: lists, loops, and functions\n\n2.6.1 Creating and using lists\nBefore diving into numerical simulations, it’s useful to get acquainted with the basic syntax and features of Python. One of the simplest and most commonly used data structures is the list, which stores a sequence of elements. Lists are flexible—they can contain numbers, strings, or even other lists.\nHere’s how to create and access elements in a list:\n\n\nfruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nprint(f'First fruit: {fruits[0]}')\n\nFirst fruit: apple\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.2 For loops\nA for loop allows us to iterate through each item in a collection and execute the same block of code for every element. You will use loops constantly—whether you are sweeping parameter values, accumulating results, or analysing datasets—so it is worth seeing the syntax early.\n\n\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(f'I like {fruit}')\n\nI like apple\nI like banana\nI like cherry\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Defining functions\nFunctions bundle reusable logic behind a descriptive name. In quantum‑optics simulations, well‑structured functions help keep notebooks tidy—for instance, collecting the code that builds a Hamiltonian or evaluates an observable in one place. Below is a minimal example that squares a number.\n\n\ndef square(x):\n    return x * x\n\nprint(square(5))\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.4 Lambda (anonymous) functions\nOccasionally we only need a small, throw‑away function—say, as a callback or key in a sort operation. Python’s lambda syntax lets us declare such anonymous functions in a single line, without the ceremony of def.\n\n\nsquare_lambda = lambda x: x * x\nprint(square_lambda(5))\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.5 Complex numbers\nPython has built‑in support for complex numbers, which are represented as a + bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. This is particularly useful in quantum mechanics, where complex numbers are ubiquitous.\n\n\nz = 1 + 2j\nprint(f'Complex number: {z}')\nprint(f'Real part: {z.real}')\nprint(f'Magnitude: {abs(z)}')\n\nComplex number: (1+2j)\nReal part: 1.0\nMagnitude: 2.23606797749979\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.6 Why plain Python lists can be slow\nPython lists store references to arbitrary Python objects. Each element carries its own type information and reference count. When you perform arithmetic on list elements, the interpreter must\n\nLook up the byte‑code for each operation.\nResolve types at runtime.\nDispatch to the correct C implementation.\n\nThis per‑element overhead dominates runtime in numerical workloads.\n\n\n2.6.7 Enter numpy\nTo overcome the performance limits of pure‑Python lists, we turn to NumPy, which stores data in contiguous, fixed‑type arrays and dispatches mathematical operations to highly‑optimised C (and often SIMD/GPU) kernels. The example below shows how you can express a million‑element computation in just two vectorised lines.\nnumpy provides fixed‑type, contiguous arrays backed by efficient C (or SIMD/GPU) loops. Operations are dispatched once for the whole array, eliminating Python‑level overhead and unlocking BLAS/LAPACK acceleration.\nAs an example, we can compute the sum of all the elements of a python list, comparing the performance with a numpy array.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport time # Only for benchmarking\n\nmy_list = [i / 1_000_000 for i in range(1_000_000)]\n\nstart = time.time() # start timer\nsum_list = sum(my_list)  # sum using Python list\nend = time.time()  # end timer\nprint(f'Sum using list: {sum_list}, '\n      f'Time taken: {1e3*(end - start):.4f} milliseconds')\n\nmy_list_numpy = np.array(my_list)\nstart = time.time()  # start timer\nsum_numpy = np.sum(my_list_numpy)  # sum using numpy array\nend = time.time()  # end timer\nprint(f'Sum using numpy: {sum_numpy}, '\n      f'Time taken: {1e3*(end - start):.4f} milliseconds')\n\nSum using list: 499999.5, Time taken: 7.7310 milliseconds\nSum using numpy: 499999.5, Time taken: 0.4444 milliseconds\n\n\n\nNumPy is also able to perform vectorized operations, which let us express complex computations in a few lines of code. For example, we can compute a function of all elements in an array without writing explicit loops. This is not only more readable but also significantly faster, as the underlying C code can be optimised for performance.\n\n\n# Vectorized array operations\nx = np.linspace(0, 100, 1_000_000)\ny = np.sin(x) + 0.5 * x**2\nprint(y[:5])  # show first five results\n\n[0.         0.00010001 0.00020002 0.00030005 0.00040008]\n\n\n\nOne line performs a million floating‑point operations in compiled code—often orders of magnitude faster than an explicit Python loop.\n\n\n\n\nCampaioli, Francesco, Jared H.

    "text": "3.1 NumPy: The Foundation of Dense Linear Algebra\nQuantum systems are described by vectors and operators in complex Hilbert spaces. States \\(\\vert \\psi \\rangle\\) correspond to column vectors, and observables—like the Hamiltonian \\(\\hat{H}\\) or spin operators—are represented by matrices. Tasks such as finding energy spectra via eigenvalue decompositions, simulating time evolution through operator exponentials, and building composite systems with tensor (Kronecker) products all reduce to core linear‐algebra operations.\nIn this chapter, we will leverage NumPy’s and SciPy’s routines (backed by optimized BLAS/LAPACK) to perform matrix–matrix products, eigen-decompositions, vector norms, and more. When system size grows, SciPy’s sparse data structures and Krylov‐subspace solvers will let us handle very large, structured operators efficiently.\nBy blending physical intuition (Schrödinger’s equation, expectation values, operator algebra) with hands‐on Python code, you’ll see how powerful and intuitive modern linear‐algebra libraries can be for quantum‐mechanics simulations. Let’s get started!\nNumPy provides the ndarray type, an efficient, N-dimensional array stored in contiguous memory. This layout makes vectorized operations and low-level BLAS calls blazing fast. At its simplest, a 2D ndarray represents a matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12}\\\\ a_{21} & a_{22}\\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\nand a 1D ndarray represents a column vector:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix}v_1\\\\ v_2\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nNumPy’s dense arrays form the backbone of many quantum‐simulation tasks—building Hamiltonians, computing overlaps, and propagating states all reduce to these core operations.

Notice how intuitive the syntax is: the @ operator reads like the usual linear-algebra notation.\n\n\n3.1.2 Matrix–Matrix and Matrix–Vector Multiplication\nLet’s consider a simple example of a 2×2 matrix \\(A\\) and a 2-vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). This captures key ideas: operator composition via matrix–matrix products and state evolution via matrix–vector products. Indeed, in quantum mechanics, applying one operator after another corresponds to a matrix–matrix product, while acting on a quantum state uses a matrix–vector product. Consider the following:\n\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define a 2×2 matrix and a 2-vector\nA = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nv = np.array([5, 6])\n\n# Matrix–matrix product\nc = A @ A  # same as A.dot(A)\ndisplay(\"A @ A =\", c)\n\n# Matrix–vector product\nw = A @ v  # same as A.dot(v)\ndisplay(\"A @ v =\", w)\n\n'A @ A ='\n\n\narray([[ 7, 10],\n       [15, 22]])\n\n\n'A @ v ='\n\n\narray([17, 39])\n\n\n\nHere, A @ A computes \\(A^2\\), and A @ v computes \\(A\\mathbf{v}\\).\n\n\n3.1.3 Diagonalization\nThe eigenvalue problem is one of the cornerstones of both applied mathematics and quantum mechanics. Given a square matrix \\(A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n\\times n}\\), we seek scalars \\(\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{C}\\) (eigenvalues) and nonzero vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{C}^n\\) (eigenvectors) such that\n\\[\nA \\,\\mathbf{x} = \\lambda\\,\\mathbf{x}.\n\\]\nPhysically, in quantum mechanics, \\(A\\) might be the Hamiltonian operator \\(\\hat H\\), its eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) correspond to allowed energy levels, and the eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) represent stationary states. Mathematically, diagonalizing \\(A\\) transforms it into a simple form\n\\[\nA = V \\,\\Lambda\\, V^{-1},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Lambda\\) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and the columns of \\(V\\) are the corresponding eigenvectors. Once in diagonal form, many operations—such as computing matrix exponentials for time evolution, powers of \\(A\\), or resolving a system of differential equations—become trivial:\n\n\\[\nf(A) = V\\,f(\\Lambda)\\,V^{-1},\\quad\nf(\\Lambda) = \\mathrm{diag}\\bigl(f(\\lambda_1),\\dots,f(\\lambda_n)\\bigr).\n\\]\nIn practice, NumPy’s np.linalg.eig calls optimized LAPACK routines to compute all eigenpairs of a dense matrix:\n\n\nw, v = np.linalg.eig(A)\ndisplay(\"Eigenvalues:\", w)\ndisplay(\"Eigenvectors (as columns):\\n\", v)\n\n'Eigenvalues:'\n\n\narray([-0.37228132,  5.37228132])\n\n\n'Eigenvectors (as columns):\\n'\n\n\narray([[-0.82456484, -0.41597356],\n       [ 0.56576746, -0.90937671]])\n\n\n\nUnder the hood, NumPy calls optimized LAPACK routines to diagonalize dense matrices.\n\n\n3.1.4 Kronecker Product\nIn quantum mechanics, the state space of a composite system is the tensor product of the state spaces of its subsystems. If system 1 has Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal H_A\\) of dimension \\(m\\) and system 2 has \\(\\mathcal H_B\\) of dimension \\(p\\), then the joint space is \\(\\mathcal H_A\\otimes\\mathcal H_B\\) of dimension \\(m p\\). Operators on the composite system factorize as tensor (Kronecker) products of subsystem operators. For example, if \\(A\\) acts on system 1 and \\(B\\) on system 2, then \\[\nA\\otimes B\\;:\\;\\mathcal H_A\\otimes\\mathcal H_B\\to \\mathcal H_A\\otimes\\mathcal H_B\n\\] has matrix elements \\[\n(A\\otimes B)_{(i\\,,\\,\\alpha),(j\\,,\\,\\beta)}\n    = A_{ij}\\,B_{\\alpha\\beta},\n\\] and in block form \\[\nA \\otimes B\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n    a_{11}\\,B & a_{12}\\,B & \\cdots & a_{1n}\\,B \\\\\n    \\vdots    &        &        & \\vdots     \\\\\n    a_{m1}\\,B & a_{m2}\\,B & \\cdots & a_{mn}\\,B\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\] yielding an \\(mp\\times nq\\) matrix when \\(A\\in\\mathbb C^{m\\times n}\\) and \\(B\\in\\mathbb C^{p\\times q}\\).\nWhy is this useful? In later chapters we will build multi‐qubit gates (e.g. CNOT, controlled-phase), couple different oscillators, and assemble large Hamiltonians by taking tensor products of single‐mode operators. The Kronecker product lets us lift any local operator into the full, composite Hilbert space.\nIn NumPy, the Kronecker product is computed with np.kron:\n\n\nB = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])  # Pauli-X matrix\nkron = np.kron(A, B)\ndisplay(\"A ⊗ B =\", kron)\n\n'A ⊗ B ='\n\n\narray([[0, 1, 0, 2],\n       [1, 0, 2, 0],\n       [0, 3, 0, 4],\n       [3, 0, 4, 0]])\n\n\n\nKronecker products build composite quantum-system operators from single-subsystem operators.",

    "section": "3.5 Sparse Matrices",
    "text": "3.5 Sparse Matrices\nAs quantum systems scale to many degrees of freedom, the underlying operators—such as Hamiltonians or Liouvillian superoperators—grow exponentially in dimension but often remain highly structured and sparse. Instead of storing dense arrays with mostly zeros, sparse-matrix formats only record nonzero entries and their indices, dramatically reducing memory requirements. Common physical models, like spin chains with nearest-neighbor couplings or lattice Hamiltonians, have only \\(\\mathcal{O}(N)\\) or \\(\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)\\) nonzero elements, making sparse representations essential for large-scale simulations.\nIn the following sections, we will:\n\nConstruct sparse matrices in COO formats with SciPy.\nIllustrate basic sparse-matrix operations (matrix–vector products, format conversions).\nUse scipy.sparse.linalg.eigs (Arnoldi) to compute a few eigenvalues of a sparse Hamiltonian.\n\nThe Coordinate (COO) format is a simple way to store sparse matrices. Instead of storing all entries, the COO format only keeps nonzero entries of the form \\((i, j, a_{ij})\\), which saves memory and speeds up computations. Graphically, a 5×5 example with 4 nonzeros might look like:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n7 & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & 1 \\\\\n\\cdot & \\cdot & 2      & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n\\cdot & 3      & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n\\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n4      & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nHere each number shows a location and its value. COO is very simple and intuitive, but not the most efficient. For larger matrices, we can use the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) or Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) formats, which store the nonzero entries in a more compact way. The CSR format is very efficient for matrix–vector products.\nSuch matrix can be created in SciPy using the coo_matrix class:\n\n\nfrom scipy import sparse\n\n# Create a sparse COO matrix\ni = [0, 0, 1, 2, 4] # row indices\nj = [0, 4, 2, 1, 0] # column indices\ndata = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4] # nonzero values\ncoo = sparse.coo_matrix((data, (i, j)), shape=(5, 5))\ncoo\n\n&lt;COOrdinate sparse matrix of dtype 'int64'\n    with 5 stored elements and shape (5, 5)&gt;\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to convert between different sparse formats. For example, to convert a COO matrix to CSR format, you can use the tocsc() method:\n\n\n# Convert COO to CSR format\ncsr = coo.tocsr()\ncsr\n\n&lt;Compressed Sparse Row sparse matrix of dtype 'int64'\n    with 5 stored elements and shape (5, 5)&gt;\n\n\n\nAnd the matrix–vector product is as simple as:\n\n\n# Matrix–vector product\nv = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nw = coo @ v  # same as coo.dot(v)\nw\n\narray([12,  6,  6,  0,  4])\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Eigenvalues of Sparse Matrices\nEven with sparse storage, direct methods (dense diagonalization or full factorization) become intractable when the matrix dimension exceeds millions. To extract a few extremal eigenvalues or approximate time evolution, Krylov-subspace approaches (like the Arnoldi algorithm) build a low-dimensional orthonormal basis that captures the action of the operator on a subspace. By repeatedly applying the sparse matrix to basis vectors and orthogonalizing, Arnoldi produces a small Hessenberg matrix whose eigenpairs approximate those of the full operator. This hybrid strategy leverages both memory-efficient storage and iterative linear algebra to access spectral properties of huge quantum systems.\nTo approximate a few eigenvalues of a large, sparse matrix \\(A\\), SciPy’s eigs implements the Arnoldi algorithm. Under the hood it builds an \\(m\\)-dimensional Krylov basis. More precisely, given a starting vector \\(v_1\\) with \\(\\|v_1\\|_2 = 1\\), the \\(m\\)‑dimensional Krylov subspace is\n\\[\n\\mathcal{K}_m(A, v_1) = \\operatorname{span}\\{v_1, Av_1, A^{2}v_1, \\dots, A^{m-1}v_1\\}.\n\\]\nThe Arnoldi iteration produces the decomposition\n\\[\nA V_m = V_m H_m + h_{m+1,m}\\, v_{m+1} e_m^{\\top},\n\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(V_m = [v_1, \\dots, v_m]\\) has orthonormal columns,\n\\(H_m\\) is an \\(m \\times m\\) upper‑Hessenberg matrix,\n\\(e_m\\) is the \\(m\\)‑th canonical basis vector.\n\nThe eigenvalues of \\(H_m\\) are called Ritz values; they approximate eigenvalues of \\(A\\). As \\(m\\) grows, the approximation improves. In practice we combine Arnoldi with a restart strategy (after reaching a given \\(m\\) we keep the most accurate Ritz vectors and build a fresh Krylov basis). SciPy’s scipy.sparse.linalg.eigs wrapper uses the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method from ARPACK.\nAs a pseudo-code, the Arnoldi algorithm can be summarized as follows:\n\nPick a random vector \\(v\\) and normalize it.\nFor \\(j = 1, \\dots, m\\)\n\n\\(w = A v_j\\)\nOrthogonalize: \\[h_{i,j} = v_i^{\\dagger} w, \\quad w \\leftarrow w - h_{i,j} v_i \\quad (i = 1, \\dots, j)\\]\n\\(h_{j+1,j} = \\|w\\|_2\\).\nIf \\(h_{j+1,j} = 0\\), stop (the Krylov subspace is invariant).\n\\(v_{j+1} = w / h_{j+1,j}\\).\n\n\nThe cost is \\(m\\) sparse matrix–vector products and \\(\\mathcal{O}(m^2 n)\\) scalar operations for orthogonalization (which stays moderate when \\(m \\ll n\\)).\nHere’s a concrete example:\n\n\nfrom scipy.sparse.linalg import eigs\n\n# Compute the 2 largest-magnitude eigenvalues of coo\nvals, vecs = eigs(coo, k=2)\ndisplay(\"Sparse eigenvalues:\", vals)\n\n'Sparse eigenvalues:'\n\n\narray([7.53112887+0.j, 2.44948974+0.j])",

    "text": "4.2 JAX: XLA Compilation and Automatic Differentiation\nJAX is a high-performance library from Google Research that extends NumPy with just-in-time compilation and automatic differentiation. It - Compiles array operations via XLA, fusing kernels and reducing Python overhead. - Supports GPU and TPU backends with minimal code changes. - Provides grad for gradients of scalar functions, enabling optimisation and machine-learning tasks. - Offers advanced transformations like vmap (vectorisation) and pmap (parallelism on multiple devices).\nJAX is widely used in deep learning frameworks (e.g. Flax, Haiku), reinforcement learning, and scientific research (including physics simulations), thanks to its blend of speed and flexibility.\n\n4.2.1 A Quick Overview of Automatic Differentiation\nAutomatic differentiation (AD) is a family of techniques to compute exact derivatives of functions defined by computer programs. Unlike symbolic differentiation (which can lead to expression swell) or numerical finite-difference (which suffers from truncation and round-off error), AD exploits the fact that any complex function is ultimately composed of a finite set of elementary operations (addition, multiplication, sin, exp, …) whose derivatives are known exactly.\n\nLimitations of Finite Differences\nA common finite-difference formula for a scalar function \\(f(x)\\) is the central difference\n\\[\n\\frac{df}{dx}(x)\\approx \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h},\n\\]\nwith local truncation error \\(\\mathcal{O}(h^2)\\). However, this approach has important limitations:\n\nTruncation vs. round-off: If \\(h\\) is too large, the \\(\\mathcal{O}(h^2)\\) term dominates. If \\(h\\) is too small, floating-point cancellation makes the numerator \\(f(x+h)-f(x-h)\\) inaccurate.\nCost with many parameters: For \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), the gradient component \\(i\\) is\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(\\mathbf{x})\\approx \\frac{f(\\mathbf{x}+h\\mathbf{e}_i)-f(\\mathbf{x}-h\\mathbf{e}_i)}{2h}.\n\\]\nComputing all \\(n\\) components requires \\(2n\\) evaluations of \\(f\\), so the cost scales as \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) in \\(f\\)-calls. For large \\(n\\) (many parameters), this becomes prohibitive.\nNon-smooth or branching code: When \\(f\\) contains control flow or non-differentiable operations, finite differences may give misleading or undefined results.\n\n\n\nAutomatic Differentiation and the Chain Rule\nAutomatic differentiation (AD) applies the chain rule to each elementary operation in code (addition, multiplication, sin, exp, etc.), yielding exact derivatives up to floating-point precision. For a composition\n\\[\nu = g(x),\\quad y = f(u),\n\\]\nAD uses the chain rule:\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{df}{du}\\frac{dg}{dx}.\n\\]\nIn more complex nests, e.g.\n\\[\nv = h(u),\\quad u = g(x),\\quad y = f(v),\n\\]\nwe get\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{df}{dv}\\frac{dh}{du}\\frac{dg}{dx}.\n\\]\nAD comes in two modes:\n\nForward mode (propagate derivatives from inputs to outputs).\nReverse mode (propagate sensitivities from outputs back to inputs).\n\nJAX implements both and selects the most efficient strategy automatically.\n\n\nComparing Accuracy: AD vs Finite Differences\nBelow is a Quarto code cell that plots the error of finite differences (varying step size \\(h\\)) and automatic differentiation against the true derivative of \\(f(x) = e^{\\sin(x)}\\) at \\(x=1.0\\).\n\n\nimport jax\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for plotting\n\n# Set JAX to use 64-bit floats\njax.config.update(\"jax_enable_x64\", True)\n\n# Define function and true derivative\ndef f_np(x):\n    return np.exp(np.sin(x))\n\ndef df_true(x):\n    return np.cos(x) * np.exp(np.sin(x))\n\n# Point of evaluation\nx0 = 1.0\n\n# Finite-difference errors for varying h\nhs = np.logspace(-8, -1, 50)\nerrors_fd = []\nfor h in hs:\n    df_fd = (f_np(x0 + h) - f_np(x0 - h)) / (2 * h)\n    errors_fd.append(abs(df_fd - df_true(x0)))\n\n# Automatic differentiation error (constant)\ndf_ad = jax.grad(lambda x: jnp.exp(jnp.sin(x)))(x0)\nerror_ad = abs(np.array(df_ad) - df_true(x0))\n\nprint(f\"AD error: {error_ad}\")\nprint(f\"FD minimum error: {min(errors_fd)}\")\n\n# Plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6.122, 2.5))\nax.loglog(hs, errors_fd, marker=\"o\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Step size $h$\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Error of Finite Differences\")\nplt.show()\n\nAD error: 0.0\nFD minimum error: 7.006839553014288e-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot illustrates that finite differences achieve minimal error at an optimal \\(h\\), but degrade for too large or too small \\(h\\), while AD remains accurate to machine precision regardless of step size.",

    "text": "4.3 Why Computing Gradients Is Important in Quantum Physics\nIn quantum physics, many problems reduce to optimizing parameters in a model or a control protocol. Computing gradients of a cost function with respect to these parameters is essential for efficient and reliable optimization.\n\nVariational quantum algorithms: In methods like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)(Peruzzo et al. 2014), a parametrised quantum state \\(|\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rangle\\) depends on parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=(\\theta_1,\\dots,\\theta_n)\\). One minimises the expectation \\[\nE(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\langle\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})|\\hat H|\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rangle.\n\\]\nGradient-based methods require\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\theta_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_i} \\langle\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})|\\hat H|\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rangle.\n\\]\nAD enables exact evaluation of these derivatives through the quantum circuit parameters, improving convergence compared to gradient-free methods.\nQuantum optimal control(D’Alessandro 2021; Khaneja et al. 2005): One shapes control fields \\(u(t)\\) in the Hamiltonian \\[\n\\hat H(t; u) = \\hat H_0 + \\sum_i u_i(t) \\hat H_i\n\\]\nto drive the system from an initial state \\(|\\psi_0\\rangle\\) to a target \\(|\\psi_T\\rangle\\).
